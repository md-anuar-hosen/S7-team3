* `/docs/architecture/components.png` — Component diagram (PNG/PDF), acyclic
* **One of** `/docs/architecture/openapi.yaml` **or** `/docs/architecture/interfaces.md`
* `/docs/architecture/nfr_mapping.csv` — NFR → Tactic → Components → Verification mapping
* `/docs/architecture/tradeoffs.md` — ≤300 words
* `/S8/review_notes/TEAM_X.md` — outgoing Strong/Risk/Question notes + inbound summary

## Verification artifact(s)

* `/evidence/EV-perf-rsvp.pdf` (example) — k6 run report

## Tests / scripts (optional but recommended)

* `/S8/tests/T-PERF-01.js` — k6 skeleton for verifying p95 latency
* `/S8/tests/T-A11Y-01.sh` — pa11y one-liner

## Quick cross-check for graders

1. Click `docs/architecture/openapi.yaml` or `interfaces.md` to inspect the 3–5 interface contracts.
2. Open `docs/architecture/nfr_mapping.csv` and confirm at least two NFR rows and that one row references `evidence/EV-*`.
3. Open `/evidence/` and ensure at least one artifact exists (pa11y/k6/ZAP/uptime).
4. Check `/S8/review_notes/TEAM_X.md` for Strong / Risk / Question entries and the summary of feedback received.
